    <p>Impressive rainbow cake is the perfect way to wow your kids at their next birthday
        party. It’s deceptively simple
        to make too – all you need is basic cake ingredients and a rainbow of food colouring!
    </p>

        To make the buttercream,
        place the salted butter in the bowl of an electric mixer. Sift the icing sugar on top, bring the mixture
        together at a low speed, then beat at high speed for a few minutes until the mixture is pale and fluffy. Add the
        vanilla extract and beat to combine.
